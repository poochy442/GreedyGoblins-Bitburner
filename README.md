# Greedy Goblins Bitburner Shared Code Space

Welcome to the Greedy Goblins Bitburner shared code space!

To get started, make sure you have the Bitburner extension installed in your VS Code. Once installed, you'll need to start the API Server in-game, and copy the auth code into the settings.

Once you're authenticated, you can contribute your own code by placing it in the `/out` directory. This directory serves as a staging area for code that will be sent to Bitburner.
Please ensure you create a folder for all code in `/out`, so the code is nice and organized when sent to Bitburner.

Happy hacking, Goblins!
